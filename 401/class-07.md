## Class 07: Inheritance Question

This reading assignment has no reading materials, instead asks us to post a question about inheritance, interfaces, or object-oriented design.
Then, answer one of your classmates' questions.

### What I want to know more about

Interfaces: So, when this class began we were told that if something is not a primitive data type, it is an object, ammended only to say that if it isn't 
a primitive data type nor an object then it is a class, but then if it isn't a primata, object, or class, then it is clearly a method/function that produces
some form of primata, or object... ... That's just in terms of 'data types'. But the concept of Interfaces, are they even necessary? Is it a condition of Java 
to do everything with extra steps? The two reasons I found as to "Why Interface?", 1: 'To achieve security' & 2: 'Java does not support "multiple inheritance (classes 
can only inherit from one 'superclass')". Is 1, security, not accomplished via public, private, protected (even default 'no modifier') class modifiers? 

It leaves me wondering if interfaces are mostly one of those stepping stone items one learns along the way that is not infact a best practice?
Something implemented when updating a codebase as to change anything previously written & working...?
