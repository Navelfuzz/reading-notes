# Class 10 Readings: Debugging

## What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

[What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

*Questions*

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

*Answers*

1. Syntax errors are improperly written code that produces erroneous levels of function. Logic Errors are innappropriately comparing data producing an undesired result.
A syntax error is kind of a grammatical error whereas a logic error is more of getting the math wrong.
2. Syntax errors are common for me, mostly in terms of missing a `;` or perhaps not properly structuring a function or object in terms of input data and output data.
3. The repetition of fixing my own mistakes is foundational to any new skill.

## The JavaScript Debugger

[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

*Questions*

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
3. What is the call stack?

*Answers*

1. A useful tool available within web browsers that helps a developer monitor the real time function of their code to help realizes the cause of bugs and errors.
2. A point as a developer which you set for your code to pause its execution. Helps to determine where things go wrong before or after.
3. The call stack is this "structure" that retains the order of things being done. Calling functionA(param1, param2) calls 2 parameters, one from a global variable another from the result of
functionB() so then functionB() sits on top of functionA() on the stack. The stack has a LIFO orientation.
