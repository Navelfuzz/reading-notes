### Questions

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

### Answers

1. Seems like SSH or PGP keys
2. Testing makes sure that our code modules are working as intended. 
    * Identifying Defects and Bugs: Testing helps uncover defects, bugs, and errors in software, products, or systems. These defects could lead to malfunctions, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. By identifying and rectifying these issues early in the development process, organizations can save time, resources, and maintain a positive user experience.
    * Ensuring Reliability and Stability: Robust testing ensures that a product or system functions reliably under different conditions. Through various testing methodologies, including stress testing, performance testing, and load testing, potential bottlenecks, crashes, or performance degradation can be identified and addressed. This reliability is essential for maintaining user trust and preventing costly downtimes.
    * Enhancing User Experience: Testing helps in fine-tuning the user experience by identifying usability issues, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement. By gathering feedback through testing, developers can make user-centric adjustments, resulting in a smoother, more intuitive experience for end-users.
    * Meeting Requirements and Standards: Different industries have specific regulations, standards, and requirements that products and systems must adhere to. Testing ensures that these standards are met and maintained. This is especially crucial in sectors like healthcare, aviation, and finance, where safety and compliance are paramount.

    Identifying bugs and defects is most important to me, I'm quite prone to typing errors.
3. The back stack is simply a stack that holds what tasks have been opened so a user can hit the "back button" or swipe back and exit the way they entered.
