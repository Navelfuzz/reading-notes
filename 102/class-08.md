## Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

### Questions

1. What is an `expression` in JavaScript?
2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
3. When does a `for` loop stop executing?
4. How many times will a `while` loop execute?

### Answers

1. An expression is any valid set of variables, operators, and expressions that evaluate to a single value. The value may be a number, string, or logical value.
2. A loop would be used to repeat an expression until the solution is resolved.
3. A `for` loop will stop executing when the count of the loop reaches our pre-determined cutoff point.
4. A `while` loop will continue until the expression is satisfied. The rule of thumb is to use a while loop when it is unknown how many iterations will be required to resolve the expression.
