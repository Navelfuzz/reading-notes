Emotional intel:
Lately I finde that I've been somewhat quicker to anger and frustrated with many things going on in life. But I consider myself a fairly emotionally intelligent and self aware person. My VA case manager wrote that in medical notes in my record so... cased closed on that really.. 

I find that "emotional intelligence" is a plant, fertilized by failures. Anecdotal experience perhaps, but I'm of the opionion that most young men don't finally see germination until their ~mid 20s. It was certainly the case for me. Learning to 'observe' yourself is a good skill. Idk why they didn't pound that in to us in boot camp, would probably solve a lot of issues... they already have you at daycare they may as well teach you manners lol

Biases:
I always hate these types of questionnaires. Not because I disagree with the purpose or content but because I hate agreeing to preformed answers that I am unable to articulate myself in my own way, which causes a lot of consternation on how I should answer the question. Beyond that, many of the assignments and requirements of course here at Code Fellows tell me the same thing about myself which is that I need to expand my ‘social network’ (imo both personally and professionally). I’ve been somewhat secluded for the last ~4 years. It’s not that naturally I’m a hermit but I’m one of those that began college in the COVID era so the networking and social interactions usually associated with college didn’t happen for me. I have experiences from the past that I refer to mentally as it pertains to the questions in the Bias assessment but I would say that the professional space has changed in many ways since I was last employed. However, I was in the military and there was only one unit I was stationed at which I did not have a daily workspace that was extremely diverse. I think that “growing up in the military” is an interesting experience that perhaps gives perspective that those who don’t serve miss out on to an extent (not to say it is the end all be all), but if I were to think of a “common denominator” of “everyone has an equal opportunity” I would say that boot camp graduates (speaking of my service US Coast Guard) all start at the same point with is “square one” with a structure that treats them all equally. I will qualify that there are certainly factors beyond that ‘structure’ such as the human factor of the people at your first unit, those that are in your chain of command, and others, that make it imperfect. But the organization has such a diverse group of people within it that in ways… in certain ways… it is somewhat ‘progressive’ as a byproduct of its makeup. Having been in from the ages of 17 to 30 I saw many things happen that are examples of negative bias towards every possible demographic marker from the small mishap that was resolved via apology to the worst examples of sexual harassment/assualt and racist behaviors. What I can say reflecting upon this experience and my upbringing and how I think about these situations is that I’m grateful to come from a family that instilled values such as respecting others and treating them as I would like to be treated and also having moved many times since early childhood that I’ve met people from all walks of life that have gifted me the perspective of appreciating differences and respecting perspectives.
