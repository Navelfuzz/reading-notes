## Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript

### Questions

1. What is `control flow`?
2. What is a JavaScript `function`?
3. What does it mean to `invoke` - or `call` - a function?
4. What are the parenthesis `()` for when you define a function?

### Answers

1. The order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
2. A set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It takes some input and returns some output and can be used repetitively when called upon.
3. Calling a function means typing the function name: `function()` followed by parentheses, which will have pass through variables in them (if applicable) and by doing this we are telling our function to run at this point in the program.
4. They are the container which we pass variables to use within our function. If our function is `a + b = c` then perhaps we define `a` and `b` outside the function earlier on somehow and pass them to our function which will calculate `c`. Which will look like `function(a, b)`.
