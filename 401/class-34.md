2. What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?

### Answers

1. Releases and versioning are closely related in the context of publishing an application to the Google Play Store. Each release of an application has a version number, which is used to track changes and updates to the application over time. When you publish a new release of your application, you must increment the version number to indicate that it is a new release.

2. The 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store are:

* Create a release build of your application: This involves building a version of your application that is optimized for release, with features like debugging disabled and code obfuscation enabled.
* Test your application thoroughly: Before releasing your application, you should test it thoroughly to ensure that it is stable and free of bugs. This includes testing on a variety of devices and configurations.
* Sign your application: To publish your application to the Google Play Store, you must sign it with a digital certificate. This ensures that the application comes from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
* Create a release in the Google Play Console: Once you have a signed release build of your application, you can create a new release in the Google Play Console. This involves uploading the release build, setting the version number and release notes, and configuring other options like pricing and distribution.
* Publish your application: After creating a release in the Google Play Console, you can publish your application to the Google Play Store. This makes it available for download to users around the world.
