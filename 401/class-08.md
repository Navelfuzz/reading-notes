## Readings

[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
[Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))

### Questions

1. Are there any projects that youâ€™ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
2. Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?

### Answers

1. Most certainly. Both 201 and 301 Final Projects could use a going over and the CSS especially could be consolidated heavily.
2. I really enjoy the modularization of C++ that I learned in my college material, now that we're dealing with Java inheritance in the scope of this 401 course I would structure out classes which employ inheritance to minimize redundantly written code. Or host a library of generic functions that can be called in an application.

### Questions

1. Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.
2. What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.

### Answers

1. Testing ideas/barebones implementations which reduces time to build. 
2. Waiting until 'full maturity' seems like you're developing to then remain static, when you learn different use cases (OS's, platforms, etc..), could incorporate other features based on user/observer feedback, fully develop a product in the hands of others to broaden one's own perspective.
