## Class 10: Stacks & Queues

### Implementation: Stacks & Queues

To turn in your reading "Reply" to this discussion by teaching something that you've learned. Then Reveiw what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for topics:
* Use an analogy
* Explain a detail in depth
* Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
* Tutorial / walk through an example
* Write a quiz
* Create a vocabulary/definition list
* Write a cheat sheet
* Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
* Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
* Build a map of the information
* Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

### Talking Point:

Stacks & Queues are rather similar. They are both linear data structures. Stacks follow a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Queues a First In, First Out (FIFO). Stacks would act like placing barbell weights onto a barbell sleeve. As I add plates to the sleeve I can only remove them one at a time, and I can only remove the last one placed upon the bar. Queues are like cars moving through a tunnel. 
Things new to me were the queue actions `enqueue`, `dequeue`, which adds and removes a node from a queue respectively.
