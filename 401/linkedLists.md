# CF 401: Java // Reading Notes

## Class 05: Linked Lists

### Implementation: Linked Lists

To turn in your reading "Reply" to this discussion by teaching something that you've learned. Then Reveiw what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for topics:
* Use an analogy
* Explain a detail in depth
* Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
* Tutorial / walk through an example
* Write a quiz
* Create a vocabulary/definition list
* Write a cheat sheet
* Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
* Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
* Build a map of the information
* Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

### Talking Point:

Worst, Best, Average Cases

Within the concept of Big-O notation are the Worst-case, Best-case, and Average case time complexities. These are determined based on an input to an algorithm `n` and the maximum amount of time which the algorithm takes to complete execution. Worst-case descrives the upper bound, best-case the lower bound, and average-case considers the distribution of inputs and how the algorithm performs on average. Of note, these are described as:
* Worst-Case: Big O Notation
* Best-Case: Big Omega Notation
* Average-Case: Big Theta Notation
