### Questions

1. What are variables in JavaScript?
2. What does it mean to `declare` a variable?
3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?
4. What is information received from the user called?

### Answers

1. Variables are a name of a storage location. It's a way to store a value to refer to later.
2. Declaring a variable is "initializing" it. Meaning we state we wish to make a variable, give it a name (a location to store it), and give it a value.
3. The assignment operator is the `=` and it assigns a value to a name/location.
4. User input is obtained via `prompt()` and is typically referred to as either external or user input.
