### Questions

1. Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.
2. What is the benefit of asynchronus methods?

### Answers

1. GitHub Copilot: 1. Asynchronous methods are methods that allow a program to continue executing while waiting for a long-running operation to complete. Instead of blocking the program until the operation is finished, asynchronous methods return immediately and provide a way for the program to be notified when the operation is complete.

2. The benefit of asynchronous methods is that they can improve the responsiveness and performance of a program, especially when dealing with long-running or I/O-bound operations. By allowing the program to continue executing while waiting for the operation to complete, asynchronous methods can prevent the program from becoming unresponsive or blocking other operations. This can lead to a better user experience and improved overall performance. Additionally, asynchronous methods can make it easier to write concurrent and parallel code, as they provide a way to execute multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the program.
