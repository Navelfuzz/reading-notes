## Summary of Articles

### Ethics in the Workplace

#### The code I'm still ashamed of 

This story is one of a developer naively chocking a rigged survey up to a marketing ploy and feeling guilt that the medication it recommends (in advertisement) can cause thoughts of suicide & depression. I can sympathize with those in similar positions, feeling they are responsible for harm in some way but this particular example I in no way really see the fault of the developer. I see some form of "survivorship guilt" (or whatever guilt form would apply to this) but I think this highlights a weird thing in our society.. why are medications advertised to patients? I think I would probably have a stroke if I were a physician and some random patient of mine walked into my office asking for a specific medication rather than attention to an ailment #1. And also there's the responsibility patients have to read their prescription information materials to understand risks. That's not to say it is not tragic. What I'm trying to articulate is that there are things that seem innocuous advertising gimmicks that are risks to real peoples live in ways difficult to predict at face value. The world can be so many different shades of gray at one time.  

### Ethics in Technology

#### The Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

THe article written by Peter Nowak back in February of 2018 opens witha quote of Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford, "Nobody's talking about ethics". As per usual I'm not surprised that a company nowhere near the lead in innovation is trying to bring up escuses for mor time to compete in the marketplace... But the point is correct. There are some pretty in depth issues to be ironed out with automated technology within everyday society, not just on factory floors. I'm of the opinion that since a hunting rifle in the hands of the consumer alleviates the gun manufacturer of liability software should likely act similarly. Granted if a rifle company produced a faulty weapon and the barrel were to explode injurying its wielder, then like many manufacturers, they could likely be found liable.. so with self driving I'm of the opinion that the owner of the vehicle (such as a Tesla Model S) can choose to either drive in manual mode, or drive in auto mode. If software were regulated to be tested prior to update release, and overall risk chances were published to the driver/owners of the vehicles a they choose self driving, then the onus falls on the operator in my mind. Outside of exceptions such as development malfeasance or gross neglect of regulations etc..
