# Readings: Image, Color, Text

## HTML Media

### *Questions*

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

### *Answers*

1. `alt` meaning alternative. In images if we have a `src` such as `image01.jpg` or perhaps an `HTML` link to source that for whatever reason doesn't load then the alternative text will displayed rather than the filename. Which can provide context to what the image is supposed to be. This could be useful if you were trying to display pictures for a set of instructions.
2. attributs such as `alt` and `title` provide additional information/context for the content on the page.
3. When you want to group together, into one container, multiple elements such as a picture and its description.
4. I would liken a gif to the early moving picture technologys or a flipbook. An svg I would describe as an image constructed using geometry laying shapes on top of one another to then "sculpt" together an image.
5. PNG, because high quality and transparency.

### *Questions*

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.

### *Answers*

1. Foreground and Background descibe a depth dimension which content can overlay other content on your display. We can format that occurence in our HTML documents. To explain it to someone I would liken it to the projectors teachers (at least used to use) with transparent sheets and varying colors of markers. I can write on my first sheet in Blue. then lay another over it and annotate comments in red for emphasis.
2. Develop a color pallete them, perhaps line different sections with different background colors and use the block structure of HTML/CSS as boundaries with opportunity for decoration.
3. First, no one takes Comic Sans seriously. So be appropriate to your goals. Make sure readabilty doesn't suffer.
4. Size controls literally the size of the characters, weight is the boldness/thickness of the characters, style is italics.
5. `letter-spacing` or `word-spacing`. These control the parameters of spacing between letters in a word or the spacing between words (effectively a spacebar adjustment).
