# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

### *Questions*

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objects property instead of dot notation.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

### *Answers*

1. An object is much like a well organized binder with a unique image on the front of it showing what the object 'is'. It has a table of contents and each divided section of it describes different aspects, features, uses, and capabilities. So in code we have an object called a soccer ball that has several different parameters and built in functions represented by different binder sections. So an object in terms of code is the organized data structure (binder) that contains all relevant parameters.
2. It is a more efficient way of communicating a series of structured, related data items and easy to work with.
3. Arrays need to be described in terms of element number identification whereas objects can be refered to by attribute name. Data content can be of any data type within an object or a function whereas arrays are not as dynamic and would require more code to achieve the same results. And objects function as a reusable template.
4. brackets allow you to access the value stored within a variable. So if you wanted to print the value of the name of a person rather than the variable you would use brackets.
5. It means that `this` object the function is inside of. Can be used in order to operate on several different objects much like using a loop to navigate through an array.

## Introduction to the DOM

### *Questions*

1. What is the DOM?
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

### *Answers*

1. The: Document Object Model. It's a programming iterface for web documents that represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content.
2. JS manipulates the DOM via Web API.
